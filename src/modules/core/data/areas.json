    "description": "Ancient Basin mainly consists of rocks and fossils with occasional roots scattered throughout the area. A Tram is located in the north part which leads to Deepnest and Kingdom's Edge. The western part of the Tram tunnel can be accessed and contains a rare Pale Ore. A fountain with a statue of the Pale King in the central area of Ancient Basin grants a Vessel Fragment if a sum total of 3000 Geo is dropped in it. If more geo than necessary is dropped, the remaining amount is not lost. The western side of Ancient Basin is the most heavily Infected, littered with spikes, bulbs of Infection, and Infected enemies such as Infected Balloons. The boss Broken Vessel can be encountered here. After it is defeated, the Monarch Wings can be found at the end of this area. The Palace Grounds are located in the eastern part of Ancient Basin, an area which can only be accessed with the Monarch Wings. This also contains a hidden Stag Station. All the way at the bottom of Ancient Basin is the locked door which leads to the Abyss.",
    "lore": "An ancient area, Ancient Basin is filled with old structures and roads that were formed as if the rock itself possessed a will. \r\nThe Pale King built his palace in Ancient Basin, and it was from there that the kingdom of Hallownest spread. He ruled Hallownest from the White Palace, rarely leaving it. The palace disappeared together with the Pale King after the Infection reappeared.",
    "how_to_access": "Ancient Basin can be accessed from the Royal Waterways by crossing the collapsed bridge which leads to the area. The Tram in Deepnest can also be used to enter Ancient Basin after the Tram Pass has been acquired.",

    "description": "The City of Tears is built in an enormous cavern below the Blue Lake. It has numerous large towers with expansive windows which offer views of the city. Going up and down these towers is possible via small lifts. The city has a notable divide between the rich and poor part. The eastern side of the city is where Hallownest's high society lived. The interiors in this part of the City of Tears are more posh and luxurious and contain a red and purple colour pattern, while the west part's interiors appear to be more common and plain with more blue colour tones. In the very centre of the city is Fountain Square, where the memorial fountain to the Hollow Knight is located. Hornet can be encountered here as well as Relic Seeker Lemm, the latter only after one of the Dreamers has been defeated. The Nailsmith's forge and Lemm's shop are located in the western side. This side also contains the City Storerooms Stag Station and the sub-area Soul Sanctum, where the Soul Master boss can be fought. Both Quirrel and Zote can be found in this part of the city under certain conditions. The eastern side of the city has most of the sub-areas including the Watcher's Spire, and the Tower of Love. The bosses Watcher Knights and the Collector can be fought in these sub-areas, respectively. In one of the towers is the Pleasure House which has the only Hot Spring of the city. Lastly the King`s Station Stag Station can be found in the very eastern part of the city.",
    "lore": "In the past, the City of Tears was known as \"the city at this kingdom's heart\", \"Hallownest's heart\", and \"Hallownest's capital city\". The Pilgrim's Way was the primary path to the city, starting in the Forgotten Crossroads and going through Greenpath, Fog Canyon, and the Fungal Wastes, ending at the great gate at the western end of the city. Travellers were promised that if they reached the capital, all their wishes would be granted and they could share in the city's glory. Goods from all across Hallownest were transported to the capital, though not many were sent back, implying an imabalance in the wealth and prosperity between the city and other parts of the kingdom. The members of the City's high society were the ones who exerted the most influence in Hallownest. Lurien the Watcher appears to have been one of the most influential figures of the city, watching over it with his telescope in the Watcher's Spire and taking notes about the city's comings and goings. When the Infection spread across Hallownest, the capital's gates were sealed in an attempt to prevent the Infection from reaching the city. However, this proved to be in vain as the entire city became Infected. Water now leaks from the Blue Lake through the cavern's ceiling, causing the rain and giving the capital its current name.",
    "how_to_access": "The City of Tears can be first accessed from several other areas of Hallownest. The west main gate can be opened from the Fungal Wastes by using the City Crest on the statue of the Great Knight Hegemol. The east part of the city can be accessed by using the Tram Pass to get to Ancient Basin and then travelling north. The Tram can also be used to reach Kingdom's Edge, which has an access point to King`s Station on its west side through a broken wall. Lastly, taking the lift in the Resting Grounds leads to the east part of the city.",

    "description": "Dirtmouth is located right above the ruins of the kingdom of Hallownest, in a barren valley with rare tufts of grass, safe from the winds of the wasteland. Many lumafly lamposts are erected in and around town. Travellers used to come through the King's Pass, west of the valley, during the kingdom's heyday. However, a large door now bars access to the pass and the bridge leading down from it collapsed, forcing the occasional wanderers through hard detours around the cliffs. The Knight reaches Dirtmouth through that pass after breaking down its stone door, marking the start of their journey through Hallownest. Dirtmouth itself is almost abandoned, with many of the houses boarded up and empty. Elderbug is the oldest remaining bug in town and the only remaining resident. Bretta and Sly, two of the missing residents, return to town if they are rescued, with Sly resuming his job as Dirtmouth's shopkeep. Besides a shop, Dirtmouth also has a Stag Station locked from the inside but reachable from any other Station. Iselda opens a map shop next to the station when a Map has been purchased or False Knight has been defeated. East of town is a graveyard which leads to a stone door barring a cave, requiring a Simple Key to open. Confessor Jiji can be found in that cave in normal mode, or Steel Soul Jinn in Steel Soul Mode. Above the door, a lift goes up to Crystal Peak, but the lever to activate it is by the mines` entrances.",
    "lore": "Dirtmouth used to be a bustling town during Hallownest's golden age, being a respite for travellers to and from the kingdom. They would reach town through King's Pass, then either head down the kingdom's roads by foot or by Stag or head straight to the crystal mines by a mechanical lift. Once the Infection spread across Hallownest, all entry points into the kingdom were sealed to prevent the spread of the Infection, including the Stag Station. Dirtmouth's old well remained as the only way to enter Hallownest. Over the years, this well was used by many wanderers and adventurers to get into the ruins of the kingdom, with few of them ever returning. When the bridge up to King's Pass crumbled away, the few travellers coming to Dirtmouth had to take circuitous routes around the cliffs. Over time, nearly everyone living in Dirtmouth went down the well, drawn in one by one by the promise of wealth, glory, or enlightenment. The town fell quiet, with none of the residents ever returning from the ruins of Hallownest.",
    "how_to_access": "The initial way to access Dirtmouth is from King's Pass, after breaking down the door at the very end of the area.",

The bubbles in the region have swirling gases trapped inside them, and the ones with an orange glow can explode when popped by The Knight or their attacks. In the west part of Fog Canyon, near the connection to the Queen's Gardens, is the Overgrown Mound where the Howling Wraiths Spell can be acquired. The Teacher's Archives are located in the centre of the area which contain the boss Uumuu who is protecting Monomon the Teacher. Quirrel can initially be found outside the building. A Charm Notch is hidden in the northeast of the area, in a room filled with explosive bubbles. On the south outskirts of the canyon Millibelle the Banker has set up a bank near Queen's Station.",
    "lore": "Fog Canyon shares many natural geological features with those of Greenpath, suggesting that the areas were not separate in the past. A guard outpost was occupied by Hallownest Crossguards. The Pilgrim's Way, a road starting in the Forgotten Crossroads and ending near the City of Tears, passes through Fog Canyon. The main feature of the area was the Teacher's Archives, where Monomon the Teacher stored all her research and the kingdom's knowledge. In an attempt to stop the Infection, Monomon became a Dreamer, sleeping for eternity in her archives, protected by the intelligent being Uumuu. At some unknown point, the Archives became a nest for the gelatinous creatures of the canyon.",

These features are deeply reflected in its inhabitants, who developed a natural mossy camouflage, allowing them to perfectly blend in with their surroundings. Throughout all of Greenpath, pillars and egg-shaped stones with swirling carvings, sometimes reaching enormous sizes, can frequently be spotted. Zote the Mighty can be found in the north part of the area being attacked by the Vengefly King. The Knight has the choice to either save him or leave him to die. In the northwest part of Greenpath, to the left of the arena where Hornet is fought, the Lake of Unn can be found with a lone Moss Knight standing on the edge of the pier next to the shrine. Further west, on the other side of the lake, Unn can be encountered at the bottom of the lake. In the southwest sector of the area, at the end of a challenging path full of thorns and Durandas, is Sheo`s Hut, where the Knight can learn the Great Slash Nail Art. In the very southeastern portion of the area, near the connection to Fog Canyon, the Stone Sanctuary can be found at the end of a dark passage below the Bench room. In the section above, lies the Hunter in his lair set up in a small cave.",
    "lore": "Greenpath is inhabited by the Mosskin Tribe, a group of plant-like bugs. They allowed the Pale King to build roads throughout their lush caves, but anyone straying from the paths would face the law of Unn. The most glaring displays of their skills of carving and construction are the Lore Tablets scattered across Greenpath and the temple built to worship their god, Unn, which is located on the shores of the Lake of Unn, where the Higher Being lives. Unn is said to have created all of the area`s flora and the Mosskin themselves from her dreams. She is calling the mosskin, who are waiting for the call to return. The region now known as Greenpath used to be much more extensive, stretching over the Queen`s Gardens and possibly Fog Canyon.",

The Mantis Tribe make their home further into the area and are equally unwelcoming to outsiders. One of the main features of the area is the large Stag Station in the west part, Queen's Station. Various NPCs are present throughout the area. Leg Eater has a shop where he sells Fragile Charms in the northeast part of the Fungal Wastes. Near his shop, Cloth can be found hiding under the ground. Quirrel can be encountered twice in the area, once in the Stag Station and later in Mantis Village. In the very south of the area, near Mantis Village, Bretta can be freed and returned to Dirtmouth. The Warrior Dream Elder Hu is found in the northeast near the entrance to the City of Tears. In the Mantis Village, the Mantis Lords can be challenged to gain access to an entrance to Deepnest. A Charm Notch can be picked up after defeating two Shrumal Ogres in the north part of the Fungal Wastes. Three Charms are found throughout the area, Dashmaster in the southeast, Spore Shroom in the southwest near Deepnest, and Mark of Pride in a chest in Mantis Village after the Mantis Lords are defeated. After picking up the Mantis Claw from Mantis Village, a Mask Shard can be acquired in Queen's Station.",
    "lore": "The native population of the Fungal Wastes mainly consists of the Mushroom Clan and the Mantis Tribe. The Mushroom Clan is a group of fungal creatures who have a shared mind. They share a border with Deepnest, whose inhabitants they were in conflict with. When the Pale King arrived in Hallownest, they accepted his rule due to their strong belief that his foresight could protect them. However, the Mantis Tribe who live in the south part of the area had no love for the kingdom of Hallownest. The Mantises agreed to a truce where they would retain sovereignty over their territory, and in return, they would keep the beasts of Deepnest at bay. The Fungal Wastes was an important area for travellers. The Pilgrim's Way, a road leading from the Forgotten Crossroads to the City of Tears, passed through the caverns. Queen's Station connected Fog Canyon and the Fungal Wastes to the Stagways, becoming a hub of travel for travellers who wanted to visit the outer edges of Hallownest. When the Infection spread across the land, the Mushroom Clan became Infected and started becoming aggressive to outsiders. While the Mantis Tribe did not fall to the Infection, they retained their tradition of attacking anyone who wandered near their village.",

Along the floor, in egg-like clumps, are globs of honey - some of which contain caches of Geo. Platforms within the area bear a hexagonal design and also appear to be formed from hardened honey. Some of these platforms, and even a wall within the Hive, are cracked, making them vulnerable to being shattered by the speeding bulk of a Hive Guardian. Found supporting the structure, are large brown pillars placed in various locations inside the Hive and providing illumination are hanging lights made out of nectar. The Hive is decorated with rod-like protrusions from the ground, which emit a dull light and crystallised honeycombs which are also densely scattered in the area. In the lower regions of the structure are chairs, tables, and shelves, all sharing a hexagonal design.",
    "lore": "The Hive is inhabited by a species of airborne warriors ruled by a queen. Though the colony exists within Hallownest, they remained separate from the kingdom's affairs, walled off from the lands of the Pale King. During Hallownest`s reign, the bees sealed up all outside accesses, save for the occasional patrolling Hivelings. Their queen died after growing so large she could no longer leave her domain. From then on, the Hive was weakened and thus eventually overtaken by the Infection. However, in comparison to other affected groups, the Hive remains orderly.",

    "description": "The Gardens are filled with overgrown vegetation, thorny vines, and neglected greenhouses. Lanterns with Lumaflies light up the area. Besides the Hallownest structures and flowering plants, tents have cropped up in the Gardens, housing the Mantis Traitors. The south-east part of the Gardens contains a corpse holding the Love Key. Below this area is the Moss Chapel where the Moss Prophet preaches. In the central part of the Queen's Gardens is a Stag Station, which can be opened by going above and around this room. Along the way, the Warrior Dream Marmu can be found. Further north is a greenhouse where the Traitor Lord is fought. The White Lady is located west of this area, alongside the corpse of Dryya. After the Traitor Lord's defeat, she grants a White Fragment, half of the Kingsoul Charm. The grave of the Traitor Lord`s daughter is located above the Stag Station. This room is important for the Delicate Flower quest.",
    "lore": "The Queen's Gardens used to belong to Unn and her Mosskin Tribe. At some point this area was annexed by the White Lady, who turned it into her well-guarded retreat. After the White Lady bound herself in her chamber in the Gardens and the Infection returned, the Gardens grew wild and became overgrown. When the Mantis Traitors were exiled from their village in the Fungal Wastes, they eventually settled in the Queen's Gardens. They now consider the gardens to be their lands.",
    "how_to_access": "There are initially three ways to enter the Queen's Gardens: two from Fog Canyon and one from Deepnest. The first entrance is below the Overgrown Mound, requiring the Shade Cloak to bypass a Shade Gate. The lower entrance requires crossing under a wall of vines with either Isma's Tear or a very well-timed Super Dash. The third entrance is in a hidden area immediately outside Mask Maker's room. Using it requires breaking a plank in the northwest corner of the room by either using the Monarch Wings or Nail-bouncing off a Little Weaver.",

    "description": "The main area of the Abyss is a giant chasm littered with the shells of Vessels who were born and then discarded. When the Kingsoul Charm is equipped, a path to a hidden area can be opened with Desolate Dive, leading to an egg that can be Dream Nailed to obtain Void Heart. To the very west is an altar surrounded by numerous screaming faces where the Abyss Shriek Spell can be acquired. To the east is the sea of Void, with a massive lighthouse standing on its shore. This lighthouse can be activated to calm down the Void Tendrils in the sea which normally lash out towards intruders, allowing the Knight to cross to the east side of the Abyss. The east side holds the Shade Cloak, in a room with a corpse holding a bowl of Void. It also appears to be where the Pale King studied the Void, as there is a research room with diagrams on the walls, as well as the Hunter's Journal entry for Void Tendrils. The Void Tendrils and Siblings found throughout the Abyss become passive once Void Heart has been acquired.",
    "lore": "Before the kingdom of Hallownest was founded, an ancient civilisation originated from or near the Abyss who worshipped the Void.When the Pale King arrived in Hallownest, he eventually discovered the Abyss and the presence of the Void. After the Infection appeared, he used the Void to turn his children into Vessels, beings with a shell filled with Void who were born in the Abyss, hoping that their emptiness could contain the Infection. The Pale King sealed the Abyss after selecting the Hollow Knight as his chosen Vessel. The shades of dead Vessels, the Siblings, still wander the bottom of the Abyss.",
    "how_to_access": "The Abyss can be accessed by going to the bottom of Ancient Basin and by having the King's Brand to unlock the entrance.",

Trials can be selected inside the head of the shell, where Little Fool oversees payment. The fights themselves take place in the arena east of the trial boards. Below the arena is a warriors' pit with a Bench and several non-hostile Fools. Tiso can be found on the Bench if he was listened to at all previous points. Zote is located here too if he was saved in Deepnest. To the west of the warriors' pit is a room where the Knight's Shade spawns if the Knight was killed during a Trial. At the very east end of the warriors' pit is a Hot Spring with a Sturdy Fool relaxing in it. The east side of the arena can be seen from the warriors' pit. Sounds of battle and cheering from the crowd can be heard, thrown weapons of Sturdy Fools and squishes of the Infection can be seen on the other side of the gate, though no enemies are visible and the gate cannot be opened or broken. A breakable wall to the very east of this leads to an area outside the back of the Colosseum. The Godmaster content Pale Lurker is found here where she can be killed for a Simple Key.",
    "lore": "The strongest warriors from all corners are drawn to Hallownest to compete in the Colosseum, where only the strongest survive.Contestants are offered the chance to become more than just another foolish bug, as they aim to take the title of champion of the Colosseum. The Colosseum captures bugs to fight in the arena, and also breeds certain creatures such as the Sharp Baldur and Armoured Squit for battle. Lord Fool oversaw the fights in the arena, and some bugs were determined to prove their strength to them. The corpses of those who die in the arena are cast into the chasm below the Colosseum. At some point, Lord Fool died, although their corpse still sits on the throne in the arena. The Colosseum itself still continues to function even after the spread of the Infection. Despite the contestants being Infected, the crowd still cheers and the warriors in the warriors' pit below the Colosseum are not aggressive.",

    "description": "The White Palace mainly consists of white and light grey architecture. The rooms contain large, tall windows which let in light from the outside. The palace is covered in white-grey leaves, roots, and ferns. Flying creatures can be seen flying away in certain areas. Besides these features, the palace is covered in buzz-saws, thorns, and spikes. The entrance to the White Palace opens after defeating the Kingsmould that guards it. After entering the palace, another Kingsmould needs to be defeated and a switch needs to be activated to gain access to the atrium of the area. This atrium contains a bench and has two hallways leading to linear areas which each have a switch at the end. Activating both of these switches opens the lift at the top of the atrium. This grants access to the upper palace. The atrium also contains an exit out of the White Palace. The northern part of the White Palace is fairly linear and eventually leads to the throne room where the Pale King's corpse is sitting on his throne. Hitting him and making him fall off drops his half of the Kingsoul Charm. Once the Pale King has fallen off the throne, the Knight can sit on the throne and a short music box tune starts playing. Picking up the half of the Kingsoul makes the Knight wake up outside the palace. This also prevents the Knight from sitting on the throne, locking the interaction forever and causing the Pale King's corpse to vanish. The area's only sub-area, the Path of Pain, can be opened by destroying a breakable wall in the room above the lift leading to the upper part of the White Palace. Completing the Path of Pain grants the Seal of Binding entry in the Hunter's Journal. After completing it this sub-area cannot be entered again.",
    "lore": "Originally located in the Palace Grounds in Ancient Basin, the White Palace was where the Pale King ruled over Hallownest. Royal Retainers were servants of the King who served in the palace, and the Kingsmoulds were guards of the palace made by the Pale King with Void in his workshop. The Hollow Knight was raised in the White Palace before being sealed in the Temple of the Black Egg. After the Infection returned and Hallownest fell to ruin, the Pale King went into hiding. The White Palace vanished from its location in Ancient Basin, and it seems the Pale King somehow took the palace with him when he fled.",
    "how_to_access": "The White Palace can be accessed by using the Awoken Dream Nail on the corpse of the Kingsmould in the Palace Grounds in Ancient Basin. The Monarch Wings are required to reach the Palace Grounds. After getting half of the Kingsoul Charm and waking up outside, the White Palace can be entered again by simply using the Dream Nail on the corpse.",

The crystals are present across the entire area, with some tunnels having crystals lining the top and bottom of the cavern. Conveyor belts can be found in many rooms which transport the crystal shards. In the centre of Crystal Peak is a Bench with the Crystal Guardian boss. Its second form, Enraged Guardian, is located above this room, which can only be accessed once the Monarch Wings are obtained. A Mask Shard can be found after this boss fight. A lift in the northwest part of Crystal Peak connects the area to Dirtmouth. On the summit of the mountain stands a statue of the Radiance which holds a Pale Ore. In the east part of the area are tunnels filled with old mining golems, one of which contains the Crystal Heart Ability. Further below this room is a Snail Shaman temple where the Descending Dark Spell can be obtained. A nearby chasm leads to the Resting Grounds.",
    "lore": "In Hallownest's prime, Crystal Peak's mines supplied the kingdom's cities with a constant supply of crystals. The crystal ore contains energy, not as powerful as Soul but less lethal. Besides regular bug miners who mined the crystals with their claw-picks, creatures such as the Shardmites and Glimbacks were used to carry around carts and machines. When the Infection took hold, many of the miners died and were subsequently reanimated. Their husks were imprinted with strong purpose, causing them to continue mining even after death. The crystals themselves have a strange power hidden within them. They glow in the darkness, and there is a bright point of searing heat inside each of them. The crystals can refract light and also emit a very soft singing sound.",
    "how_to_access": "Crystal Peak can be accessed from two rooms in the very east part of the Forgotten Crossroads. One room has a toll gate leading to Crystal Peak which can be opened for 50 Geo, but it requires the Lumafly Lantern to be able to interact with it. The other access point to Crystal Peak contains a breakable floor which can be destroyed with Desolate Dive/Descending Dark.",

Thick layers of web covering sometimes large portions of the background and twisted maze-like tunnels and passages, several having the dim glow of a bioluminescent fungus as the only source of light. Most parts of Deepnest are dark or pitch black and can be illuminated with the Lumafly Lantern. Deepnest generally finds itself in a very primal stage of development, lacking the general level of architecture seen in the rest of Hallownest. The more developed parts of Deepnest are located in its western portion. Some structures found in this area bear large outsider influence coming from the Weavers and the kingdom of Hallownest, these being the Weavers' Den, Weaver statues, the Failed Tramway, and the Stag Station. The only structures that do not fall in this category are the suspended web houses found in Distant Village and their interiors. Deepnest's eastern parts are essentially composed of dark passages and complex networks of tunnels dug by its inhabitants. A Hot Spring and a Tram leading to Ancient Basin and Kingdom's Edge are located in the southeast part.",
    "lore": "Deepnest was occupied by two intelligent arachnid groups, the Spider Tribe, which used to be one of the most intelligent species in the land of Hallownest, and the Weavers, an outsider tribe that established their own history and culture in Deepnest. Both groups lived under the rule of their queen, Herrah the Beast, and an unknown sire, who was of honoured caste. They ruled from Distant Village where Herrah`s Den was located. Deepnest was often in conflict with the Mantis Tribe and Mushroom Clan of the Fungal Wastes. When the Pale King started establishing his kingdom, Distant Village and the creatures of Deepnest completely refused his rule. His efforts of expansion were met with furious resistance. A Tramway could not be established in Deepnest due to the beasts attacking the workers. Deepnest`s sire died at a certain point, leaving Herrah as the sole ruler of Deepnest. Since she was only of common descent, she struck a deal with the Pale King to have a child with him. In return, she would become a Dreamer to save Hallownest from the Infection. When the child, Hornet, was born, Herrah went to sleep a short time later, leaving Deepnest without a formal ruler. Deepnest was eventually overcome by the Infection, its brood Infected and the Weavers fleeing to their former home.",
    "how_to_access": "There are initially four ways of entering Deepnest, three from the Fungal Wastes and one from the Queen's Gardens. The eastern part of Deepnest can be accessed by either beating the Mantis Lords in the Mantis Village or reaching the bottom of the Fungal Core nearby. To the east of the Moss Chapel, there is an entrance leading to the northeast of Deepnest located on the ground. It reveals itself once the Knight has passed it and tries to come back.
